    <h1>Hunger and Undernourishment</h1>
    <p> <ul> Having a diet which is both sufficient in terms of energy (caloric) requirements and diverse to meet additional nutritional needs is essential for good health. Undernourishment, especially in children and mothers, is a leading risk factor for death and other health consequences.

        The UN has set a global target as part of the Sustainable Development Goals to “end hunger by 2030“. Currently we are far from reaching this target.
        
        In our research on Hunger and Undernourishment we look at how many people are undernourished; where they live; childhood undernourishment; and food insecurity across the world.</ul></p>
  
    <h1>Ranges of Food Insecurity</h1>

  
    <p> <ul> While households are often described as either food secure or food insecure, four levels of food security describe the range of households’ experiences in accessing enough food. Households with high food security and marginal food security make up the food secure category, and households with low food security and very low food security make up the food insecure category.</ul></p>

    <h1>Frequency of Food Insecurity During the Year</h1>
  
    <p><ul>About one-fourth of households with very low food security at any time during the year experienced it rarely or occasionally—in only 1 or 2 months of the year. For three-fourths, very low food security recurred in 3 or more months of the year.About one-fourth of households with very low food security at any time during the year experienced it rarely or occasionally—in only 1 or 2 months of the year. For three-fourths, very low food security recurred in 3 or more months of the year.</ul></p>
  
    <p><ul>For about one-fourth of food-insecure households and one-third of those with very low food security, the occurrence was frequent or chronic.</ul> </p>
  
    <h1>Prevalence of Food Insecurity and Very Low Food Security, by Reference Period</h1>
  
  
    <p><ul>Prevalence rates of food insecurity and very low food security during the 30 days preceding the food security survey were considerably lower than the annual rates. Some households were food insecure only early in the year but not in the 30 days prior to the survey interview. </ul></p>
